\subsubsection{Usage scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item High priority task.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bob has to do some urgent work.
	\item Bob inputs the task and data. He also sets the priority option to high.
	\item System checks if the task can be directly executed somewhere.
	If that is the case, the task is executed and the scenario ends.
	\item System tries to find the running task with lowest priority.
	\item System checks if this task has lower priority than Bob's, if that is the case it gets paused and replaced with Bob's.
    \item System ensures that the paused task will be continued when that is possible.
	\item If all running tasks are with equal or greater priority, the User is notified that he has to wait.
  \end{itemize}
  \item User checks the state of the task.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bob schedules a task that he has not thoroughly tested.
    Bob is concerned that the task will not work as intended.
	\item System has available resources, so it starts the task.
	\item After 15 minutes Bob wants to check how the task is going.
	\item System enables Bob to inspect the running task.
	\item Bob finds that the task is not outputting the correct results.
	\item Bob stops the task.
	\item System removes the running instance of the task.
	\item Bob fixes the bug in the task and starts it again.
    This time everything runs fine and Bob is satisfied with the end result.
