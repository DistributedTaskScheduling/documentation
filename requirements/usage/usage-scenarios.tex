\subsection{Usage scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item High priority task.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bob has to do some urgent simulations.
			\item Bob inputs the task and data, and sets the priority option to high.
			\item System checks if the task can be directly executed somewhere.
			If that is the case, the task is executed and the scenario ends.
			\item System tries to find a running task with lower priority than Bob's task, so that Bob's task can be executed at its place.
			If that is the case, the task with lower priority is stopped and replaced with Bob's.
			\item If all running tasks are with equal or greater priority, the User is notified that he has to wait.
		\end{itemize}
	\item User checks the state of the task.
		\begin{itemize}
				\item Bob starts a new simulation, that he has never run before. Bob has some small concerns that there will be errors in the simulation.
				\item System has available resources, so it starts the simulation.
				\item After 15 minutes, Bob checks how the simulation is going.
				\item System gives Bob the possibility to inspect the running simulation.
				\item Bob finds that the simulation is not outputting the correct results.
				\item Bob stops the simulation.
				\item System removes the running instance of the simulation.
				\item Bob fixes the bug in the simulation and starts it again.
				This time everything runns fine and Bob is satisfied with the end result.
		\end{itemize}
