\subsection{Usage scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item High priority task.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bob has to do some urgent simulations.
		\item Bob inputs the task and data, and sets the priority option to high.
		\item System checks if the task can be directly executed somewhere.
		If that is the case, the task is executed and the scenario ends.
		\item System tries to find a running task with lower priority then Bob's task, so that Bob's task can be executed at it's place.
		If that is the case, the task with lower priority is stoped and replaced with Bob's.
		\item If all running tasks are with equal or greater priority, the User is notified that he has to wait.
