\section{Usage scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item High priority job.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bob has to do some urgent work.
    \item Bob inputs the job and data. He also sets the priority option to high.
    \item System checks if the job can be directly executed somewhere.
    If that is the case, the job is executed and the scenario ends.
    \item System checks if enough resources can be freed for Bob's job by pausing one or more appropriate running jobs.
    \item System ensures that the paused jobs will be continued once enough resources are available.
    \item If there are no appropriate jobs to pause, the user is notified that he has to wait and the job is added to a waiting queue.
  \end{itemize}
  \item User checks the state of the job.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bob schedules a job that he has not thoroughly tested.
    Bob is concerned that the job will not work as intended.
    \item System has available resources, so it starts the job.
    \item After 15 minutes Bob wants to check if the job is working as intended.
    \item System enables Bob to inspect the running job.
    \item Bob finds that the job is not outputting the correct results.
    \item Bob stops the job.
    \item System removes the running instance of the job.
    \item Bob fixes the bug in the job and starts it again.
    This time everything runs fine and Bob is satisfied with the end result.
  \end{itemize}
