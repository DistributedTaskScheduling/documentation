\section{Introduction}

The JobAdder project enables users to remotely execute resource-intensive tasks on a dedicated cluster of work machines.
Tasks are being distributed to work machines automatically.
The distribution reduces task execution times and peak system loads by better utilizing the available hardware.
In addition, JobAdder provides tools to inspect the state of the whole system and display statistics about user activity.
