\section{Purpose}
  \subsection{Product Goal}
    JobAdder aims to faciliate and accelerate the execution of computationally expensive jobs in a cluster of work machines.

    Currently, users need to access every single working machine manually in order to distribute their jobs over them. Even more problems arise when a group of users is involved, in that case, users have to look for the working machine with the least amount of work and add their job to it.
    
    JobAdder addresses and solves these problems. With JobAdder, users will be able to send their jobs to a central server in order to evenly distribute them over the working machines. So if there's enough workload (which is usually the case), no machine will remain idle unless it's asked to.

    Jobadder also aims to make task scheuling more user-friendly. A user doesn't have to keep checking the state of their job, they'll be notified once the job is done. There will also be more insight into the whole system by providing statistics about user activity, currently running jobs, past jobs and much more.

    Users can also set priorities so that urgent jobs are put before everything, a user is not required to pause (or cancel?) low-priority jobs manually, the scheduling algorithm takes care of that and starts high-priority jobs in the fastest possible way.

  \subsection{Target Audience}
    The target audience mostly consists of groups of users with access to several working machines, this includes, companies, academic institutions and computing centers. These users usually need remote machines to run their jobs due to high hardware requirements.
    
    JobAdder helps them exploit the full potential of their working machines while keeping things user friendly.
