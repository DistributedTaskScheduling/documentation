\subsection{Command Line Interface}
All components of JobAdder are accessible through a command line interface (CLI).
The command line interface on a machine with JobAdder installed has the following structure:
\begin{equation}
\text{<component name> <command> <options> <targets>},
\end{equation}
where the \textit{component name} can be any one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{jobadder} to access the \textit{user client}.
\item \textbf{jobcenter} to access the \textit{server}.
\item \textbf{jobworker} to access the \textit{worker client}.
\end{itemize}
Commands, options, and valid targets are and options are specified in the following sections.

Options can be added in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item By supplying their names like "-{}-option\_x -{}-option\_y=2 -{}-option\_z".
\item By supplying their abbreviations like "-x -y 2 -z".
\item By supplying their abbreviations like "-xz -y 2".
\end{itemize}

The available \textit{commands} are generally specific to the used component.
Likewise, the available \textit{options} and \textit{targets} are generally specific to the commands of a used component.
However, some commands and options are shared between components or commands.

The JobAdder CLI only uses lower-case letters.
JobAdder CLI options override the values of configuration files.
If no command is given, the general help text for the given component is printed out.
\subsubsection{Shared Options}
\jaoption{config}{c}{Overrides the global configuration file with the given configuration file.}
\jaoption{detach}{d}{Detaches the execution of the given command from the command line.}
\jaoption{help}{h}{
Prints out a list of the available commands. 
When used in conjunction with a command:
prints out more detailed information on the given command and a list of the available options.}
\jaoption{verbose}{v}{
Determines the amount of information printed out.
If set to 2, detailed information is printed out.
If set to 1, only high-level information is printed out (default).
If set to 0, no information is printed out.}
\subsubsection{User Client}
\jacommand{add}
{gpu, mount, name, priority, server, ram, threads}
{Sends one or more job requests to the server.
If targets are Docker containers the job consists of simply running the container.
If targets are configuration files with a specified terminal command the job consists of running the specified terminal command.
Otherwise targets are interpreted as terminal commands}
\jaoption{gpu}{g}{
If set to true, informs the server that the job requires a gpu.
If set to a string that can be interpreted as VRAM amount, informs the server that a GPU with this amount of VRAM is required for the job.
If set to a specific GPU model, informs the server that the job must be run on a machine with that GPU built in.
}
\jaoption{mount}{m}
{Directories that need to be mounted onto the Docker container that the job is running in.}
\jaoption{name}{n}
{Human-readable name of the job.
Defaults to user's name + job index}
\jaoption{priority}{p}
{Sets the priority of the job: urgent, high, medium, or low.
Defaults to medium.}
\jaoption{server}{s}
{Server to send the job request to.
Defaults to localhost.}
\jaoption{ram}{r}
{If set to a string that can be interpreted as RAM amount, informs the server that this amount of RAM is required for the job.}
\jaoption{threads}{t}
{If set to an integer, informs the server that this number of threads is required for the job.}

\jacommand{pause}{None}{Pauses the job with the specified name.}

\jacommand{query}{user}
{Prints out information on running/queued/past jobs (specified by target).
In addition to the one below, options from add command can be used as constraints.}
\jaoption{after}{a}{Only return jobs added after the given point in time.}
\jaoption{before}{b}{Only return jobs added before the given point in time.}
\jaoption{user}{u}{Filter query by user that added the job.}

\jacommand{resume}{None}{Resumes the job with the specified name.}

\jacommand{stop}{None}{Stops the job with the specified name.}

\subsubsection{Server}
\jacommand{start}{None}{Starts an instance of the JobAdder server.}
\jacommand{stop}{None}{Stops instances of the JobAdder server.}

\subsubsection{Worker Client}
\jacommand{start}{server}{Starts an instance of the JobAdder worker client.}
\jaoption{server}{s}
{Server to receive jobs from.
Defaults to localhost.}
\jacommand{stop}{None}{Stops instances of the JobAdder worker client.}
