\section{System model}
The core structure of the system is based on the Client/server architecture %(right?)

\subsection{Client}
The client creates a job, specifies the OS, the hardware requirements and the priority of the job. The client then sends their job to the server via CLI. \newline
The client could also interrupt or pause and resume a job during it's execution.

\subsection{Central server/Gateway machine}
The server receives jobs from clients, and passes them on to a remote working machine (/computational node). \newline
It then receives results from the computational node and sends them to the client once the task is fulfilled. \newline
During the execution of a job, further commands like pausing and interrupting can be requested from the client. \newline
The server continually (every 10s?) receives results from the working machine and saves them. \newline
The data in the server (state of jobs) is accessible through a web interface or an API.
%Or should we save the results on the computational node?

\subsection{Working machine/computational node}
A computational node receives orders from the central server and executes them. It also continually sends back results to the server.
