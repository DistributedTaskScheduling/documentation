# UML Tool
Everyone must use the same UML tool because they are usually not compatible with one another.
As of yet, we did not decide on a specific UML tool to use.

Must-have features:

- Cross-platform use (Windows and Linux)
- UML class diagrams
- UML sequence diagrams
- Git versioning (all offline tools support this because they create files)

Desirable features:

- Human-readable files (makes reviews easier)
- Generating Python code from UML class diagrams
